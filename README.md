This project is especially for those adapters that want to provide cluster
support in a very simple way based on sharding distribution model. For example,
for Redis and Memcached adapters, we can provide multiple connection pools
(connection-pool per node) and client-side sharding on top of them very easy.

## Installation

Add `nebulex_cluster` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nebulex_cluster, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.
